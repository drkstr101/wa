    title: Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
    text: >
      Modern software projects tend to be limited by organizational intricacy
      rather than technical complexity. Domain-Driven Design is an approach to
      software engineering that focuses on a domain model that has a rich
      understanding of the processes and rules of the domain.

    title: Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)
    text: >
      BDD is a way for software teams to work that closes the gap between
      business people and technical people by:


      *   Encouraging collaboration across roles to build a shared understanding
      of the problem to be solved


      *   Working in rapid, small iterations to increase feedback and the flow
      of value


      *   Producing system documentation that is automatically checked against
      the system’s behavior


      We do this by focusing collaborative work around concrete, real-world
      examples that illustrate how we want the system to behave. We use those
      examples to guide us from concept through to implementation, in a process
      of continuous collaboration.

        answer: >
          Digital on-demand training defines the future of corporate learning.
          Not only is instructor-led training costly, but it also leads to poor
          retention. On-demand training is a learning strategy that enables
          students to learn at a time, place, and level of their choosing.
